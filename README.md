## Architecture

Karere is built using modern GNOME technologies:

- **Rust**: Primary programming language for memory safety and performance
- **GTK4**: Modern toolkit with excellent Wayland support
- **LibAdwaita**: Native GNOME design language and components
- **WebKitGTK 6.0**: Efficient web rendering engine
- **Blueprint**: Declarative UI definition language
- **Flatpak**: Secure application distribution

## Privacy & Security

Karere is designed with privacy in mind:

- **Sandboxed**: Runs in a Flatpak sandbox with minimal permissions
- **Opt-in Telemetry**: All logging and crash reporting is disabled by default
- **Local Storage**: Uses standard user data directories, no external services
- **Transparent**: Open source code available for audit

## Known Limitations

### Video Attachments
Due to compatibility limitations between WebKitGTK and WhatsApp Web, **video attachments are currently not supported**. This is a platform-level limitation that affects all WebKitGTK-based browsers (including GNOME Web/Epiphany).

**What works:**
- ✅ Text messages
- ✅ Image attachments
- ✅ Document attachments
- ✅ Audio messages
- ✅ Downloading videos sent by others

This limitation is being tracked and will be resolved if/when WebKitGTK adds better support for WhatsApp Web's video processing APIs.

### MPRIS and WebKit Issue
There is a known issue with MPRIS and WebKit that causes a bug on Karere! See [WebKit Bug 282000](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=282000).

As a workaround you can disable MPRIS for the application of your interest.
To do this, create the file `/etc/dbus-1/session.d/block-karere-mpris.conf` with this content:

```xml
<busconfig>
  <policy context="mandatory">
    <deny own_prefix="org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.io.github.tobagin.karere"/>
  </policy>
</busconfig>
```

**Note:** This will block all instances of Karere from registering on MPRIS, because it uses the `own_prefix` prefix which also covers Sandboxed instances. It requires a system reboot or session restart to work.
