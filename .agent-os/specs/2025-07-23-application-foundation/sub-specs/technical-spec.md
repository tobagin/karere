# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-23-application-foundation/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-23
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Complete AdwApplicationWindow implementation with proper LibAdwaita theming and responsive design
- GApplication subclass with full signal handling (activate, shutdown, open, command-line)
- WebKitGTK build system integration with proper dependency management
- Error handling framework using GLib.Error patterns and user-facing toast notifications
- Standard GNOME application structure with desktop files and application metadata
- Meson build system configured for Flatpak development and all future dependencies
- Blueprint UI definition system integration for declarative interface design

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Minimal Foundation with Basic Window
- Pros: Quick to implement, simple structure
- Cons: Would require significant refactoring when adding complex features like WebKit

**Option B:** Complete Foundation with All Dependencies (Selected)
- Pros: Avoids future build system complications, provides robust error handling, follows GNOME standards
- Cons: More complex initial setup, larger initial dependency footprint

**Option C:** Gradual Dependency Addition
- Pros: Lighter initial setup
- Cons: High risk of build system conflicts when adding WebKitGTK later, potential architecture changes

**Rationale:** Option B ensures we have a solid foundation that can support all planned features without requiring architectural changes. WebKitGTK integration is complex and best handled from the start to avoid dependency conflicts.

## External Dependencies

- **WebKitGTK-6.0** - Required for future web content rendering and communication features
- **Justification:** Core to the application's planned functionality, complex to integrate later

- **Blueprint Compiler** - Declarative UI definition system
- **Justification:** Standard GNOME practice for maintainable UI code, integrates with LibAdwaita

- **LibSoup-3.0** - HTTP client library for future networking features
- **Justification:** Will be needed for server communication, best integrated early for consistent patterns
