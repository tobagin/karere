# Spec Requirements Document

> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish the complete foundational application structure for Karere with proper AdwApplicationWindow setup, comprehensive error handling, and build system configuration. This foundation will provide a robust base for all future feature development with integrated WebKitGTK support and standard GNOME application patterns.

## User Stories

### Application Initialization

As a developer, I want to have a complete application foundation with proper GTK4/LibAdwaita structure, so that I can build features on a stable, standards-compliant base.

The application will initialize with proper GApplication lifecycle management, handle all startup/shutdown scenarios gracefully, and provide a clean AdwApplicationWindow with integrated menu system and error handling throughout.

### Build System Setup

As a developer, I want to have a comprehensive build system configured from the start, so that I can add complex dependencies like WebKitGTK without build configuration issues.

The Meson build system will be configured with all necessary dependencies, proper Flatpak manifest setup, and development toolchain integration for seamless feature development.

### Error Handling Framework

As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback, so that I have a reliable and professional experience.

The application will implement comprehensive error handling for GApplication signals, WebKit initialization, and all critical system interactions with appropriate user feedback mechanisms.

## Spec Scope

1. **Complete AdwApplicationWindow Setup** - Full application window structure with proper LibAdwaita integration and menu system
2. **GApplication Lifecycle Management** - Complete signal handling for activate, shutdown, and all application lifecycle events
3. **WebKitGTK Build Integration** - Build system configured with WebKitGTK and all future dependencies from the start
4. **Error Handling Framework** - Comprehensive error handling patterns for all critical application components
5. **Standard GNOME Application Structure** - Proper application ID, desktop files, and GNOME platform integration

## Out of Scope

- Specific feature implementations (chat, file sharing, etc.)
- UI design beyond basic application window structure
- Network communication functionality
- User authentication systems

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete application launches with proper AdwApplicationWindow and menu integration
2. All GApplication lifecycle events are handled with appropriate error management
3. Build system successfully compiles with WebKitGTK and development dependencies configured
