## 2025-01-23: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Create Karere, a modern GTK4/LibAdwaita wrapper for WhatsApp Web on Linux desktop, targeting Linux users who prefer native applications over browser-based solutions. The application will provide comprehensive native integration including notifications, theming, logging, and crash reporting.

### Context

WhatsApp Web in browsers provides a suboptimal experience for Linux users, lacking native desktop integration, proper notification handling, and theme consistency. Existing solutions are either Electron-based (resource-heavy) or lack comprehensive debugging and observability features. Linux desktop users, particularly in the GNOME ecosystem, require a solution that integrates seamlessly with their desktop environment while providing transparency and reliability.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Electron-based wrapper**
   - Pros: Rapid development, cross-platform compatibility, extensive documentation
   - Cons: High memory usage, poor native integration, larger distribution size

2. **Simple WebKitGTK wrapper without additional features**
   - Pros: Minimal codebase, quick to implement
   - Cons: Limited differentiation, no observability, poor user experience

3. **Browser extension approach**
   - Pros: No additional application needed, works with existing browsers
   - Cons: Limited native integration capabilities, browser-dependent functionality

### Rationale

Selected native Vala/GTK4 approach because it provides optimal resource efficiency, true native desktop integration, and allows implementation of comprehensive observability features that are crucial for debugging communication applications. The decision to include logging and crash reporting from the start addresses a significant gap in existing WhatsApp wrapper solutions.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Native performance and memory efficiency compared to Electron alternatives
- True desktop integration with GNOME ecosystem (notifications, theming, accessibility)
- Comprehensive observability through structured logging and crash reporting
- Dual development/production Flatpak manifests enable streamlined development workflow
- Clear differentiation from existing solutions through observability features

**Negative:**
- Longer initial development time compared to Electron wrapper
- Platform-specific to Linux/GTK environments
- Requires maintenance of WebKitGTK integration layer
- Additional complexity from logging and crash reporting systems
